    <h2>My famous steak recipe</h2>
    <p>In this recipe we will be making perfectly cooked steaks. In particular I will be making filet mignons</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A cut of steak</li>
            <li>Fresh garlic</li>
            <li>Fresh thyme</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400-425deg</li>
            <li>First you are going to want to pat dry the steak with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper (if using salted butter, don't salt)</li>
            <li>I will mark these next steps that can be interchangable with a *. The order is technically supposed to be bake and then sear, but you can do either and it will be delicious.</li>
            <li>*Heat up a pan till it is ripping hot and then sear all sides of the steak for 2 minutes, maybe one minute on the small sides</li>
            <li>*Bake the steaks for maybe 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat up butter and minced garlic in a pan with some fresh thyme. Let the garlic cook, but don't let it burn, it will be terrible</li>
            <li>When the garlic is cooked begin basting the steaks with the butter thyme garlic mixture</li>
            <li>Let the steaks rest for 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
