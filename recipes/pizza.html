        <h2>This is a recipe for my famous pizza.</h2>
        <p>In this recipe it is going to be assumed that you have a pizza stone. Obviously this recipe can be edited to your liking. I personally prefer the toppings to be mozzarella and salami, but that is personal preference.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients (makes one pizza)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your preferred pasta/pizza sauce</li>
                <li>Flour: 2 cup</li>
                <li>Yeast: maybe a tbsp</li>
                <li>Warm water: 1 cup</li>
                <li>Sugar: 1 tsp</li>
                <li>Salt: 1 tsp</li>
                <li>Olive Oil: 2 tbsp give or take</li>
                <li>Oregano</li>
                <li>Basil</li>
                <li>Mozzarella (preferably fresh mozzarella and some shredded)</li>
                <li>The toppings you want</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>First you are going to want to prepare your dough (preferably the night before)</li>
                <li>Add the flour, salt, and spices into a mixer</li>
                <li>Poof the yeast in a seperate bowl: Mix the yeast, sugar, and water and let sit for 10 minutes</li>
                <li>Add the yeast mixture into the bowl with the flour and other items</li>
                <li>Let mix for a decent amount of time, maybe 3-7 minutes, until it is pretty formed. (You might need to help mix it, sometimes the flour gets stuck on the side)</li>
                <li>When it is formed together, add the olive oil</li>
                <li>Let rest in a warm place with towel over the bowl until ready to use, you will need more olive oil than listed for oiling the top so it doesn't dry out</li>
                <li>Turn the oven on to the max temperature setting it has and have the pizza stone inside while it preheats(I have researched many recipes, the crust will be the best if baked as hot as possible)</li>
                <li>Turn out the pizza dough onto a cookie sheet or whatever you are working with</li>
                <li>Spread out to the size you want and heavely flour the bottom of the pizza dough so that you can slide it off of the sheet. Also poke holes in the middle, keep the crust unpoked, you want that rise.</li>
                <li>When the oven is ready bake the crust for 3 minutes</li>
                <li>Take the pizza out and put the toppings on.</li>
                <li>Bake the pizza for 12 minutes with the toppings on.</li>
                <li>The fresh mozzarella can be a little watery, so let it sit for 5 minutes or more after it comes out of the oven.</li>
                <li>Slice and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
